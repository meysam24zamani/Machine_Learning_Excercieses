Campbell studied rock crabs of the genus leptograpsus in 1974. One
species, L. variegatus, had been split into two new species,
previously grouped by colour, orange and blue. Preserved specimens
lose their colour, so it was hoped that morphological differences
would enable museum material to be classified.

Data are available on 50 specimens of each sex of each species,
collected on sight at Fremantle, Western Australia. Each specimen has
measurements on: I the width of the frontal lobe FL , I the rear width
RW , I the length along the carapace midline CL , I the maximum width
CW of the carapace, and I the body depth BD in mm, in addition to
colour (species) and sex.
