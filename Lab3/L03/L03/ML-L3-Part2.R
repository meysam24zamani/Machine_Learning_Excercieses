## Exercise: Bias/Variance analysis on simulated data


set.seed(5345)
par(mfrow=c(1, 1))
library(PolynomF)

# Consider this function:

# this is the (unknown) target function and the best solution to our problem
f <- function(x) sin(x-5)/(x-5)

# From which we can sample datasets:
N <- 15
x <- runif(N,0,15)              # generate the x according to a uniform distribution p(x)
t <- f(x) + rnorm(N, sd=0.1)      # generate the t according to a gaussian conditional distribution p(t|x)

plot(data.frame(x, t))

## alongside f
curve(f, type="l", col="blue", add=TRUE)

# Exercise:

# The exercise consists in estimating bias and variance (and hence bias^2+variance)
# for different models, and deduce which (polynomial) model is better for this problem.

# To this end, you must generate many (thousands?) datasets of size N, choose one
# point x in [0,15] (I suggest x=10) and estimate bias and variance for it.
# Notice that you do not need to store the datasets.

# The models are going to be polynomials of degrees of your choice (I suggest 1,2,3,4,5,8).
